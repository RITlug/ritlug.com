Hello RITlug,

I have taken a look at the results of the whenisgood poll and based on the responses the TigerOS project meetings will be held at **11AM-12PM on Fridays**. They will be in the conference room in the link between the fish bowl and GCCIS (**University Services Center 1100**) starting on Friday October 6th. Hope to see you there!

May the light of FOSS shine upon you.
