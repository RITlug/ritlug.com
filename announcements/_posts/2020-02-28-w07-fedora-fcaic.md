Hey RITlug!

This week is a special meeting. The Fedora Community Action & Impact Coordinator (FCAIC), Marie Nordin, will be coming to give a talk to RITlug this Friday.
Marie is an active member of the [Fedora Design](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design) and [Fedora Badges](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/) teams.
One of her most recent contributions is the Fedora 31 wallpaper in conjunction with Máirín Duffy.

Now as a new member of Red Hat, Marie's main job as the FCAIC is to help support and grow the Fedora community. 
Marie will be going over her background, what it's like to be the FCAIC, what it means to contribute to Fedora without programming, and other insights working in a community management role. 


Hope to see you there!
- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)

### What is RITlug?

RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.
