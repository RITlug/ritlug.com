Hey there, RITluggers!

Our first meeting of the semester will be tomorrow (Friday 1/29) in room GOL/70-2520 from 4-6PM. Feel free to attend only part of the meeting if your schedule doesn't allow you to attend the full time. Can't make it? We'll post the meeting's presentation on our website, www.ritlug.com.

If you're new to RITlug or don't know how our meetings work, we typically use the first portion of our meetings for a presentation then break for the second half for more informal discussion and general technical support. We welcome members with any level of experience, from new to experienced.

We'll start off this semester by giving a brief overview of what RITlug is and RITlug involvement opportunities for anyone new to the club. We also want to hear what you want to see us do this semester! The second portion of the meeting we'll break and open the floor to introductions, discussions, and help.

Hope to see you there!
