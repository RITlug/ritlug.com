Howdy RITluggers!

It has been quite the chaotic past few weeks; I hope that this email finds you all in good health and spirit. 

As you all probably have assumed, RITlug will no longer have any meetings for the rest of the semester.  However, that does not conclude our semester. If you still want to engage in the open-source community at RIT, you can join FOSS hours on [Jitsi](https://fossrit.github.io/announcements/2020/03/18/virtual-foss-hours/) from 5-6 PM on Thursdays. Additionally, we are always looking for more people to join our open-source projects. Please enter the #projects channel on slack and check out some open issues on our [Github](https://github.com/ritlug/). 

We are opening the nomination process for our Eboard next year. If you are interested in helping run the club in any way, please fill out [this campus group survey](http://cglink.me/s27842). Don't feel intimidated or hesitant about joining Eboard; we are looking for people that we can mentor and teach-- we are not just going to throw you into the metaphorical fire. 

I would like to personally invite/encourage everyone to join our discourse on [slack](https://rit-lug.slack.com/) and other mediums like weekly [FOSS hours on Jitsi](https://fossrit.github.io/announcements/2020/03/18/virtual-foss-hours/). These can be stressful times with social distancing, but I want to remind everyone that you have a family that you can talk to at RITlug.

Stay safe,
