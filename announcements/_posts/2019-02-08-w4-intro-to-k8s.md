Hey RITlug!

This week's meeting is focused on container orchestration using Kubernetes.
Ever wondered how to manage a bunch of containers? Or how to autoscale your
services? Come to this week's meeting to find out how!

I will be doing an overview of what Kubernetes is, and why/when you should use it.
If any of this sounds interesting to you, come on down to this Friday's meeting!



Hope to see you there!
