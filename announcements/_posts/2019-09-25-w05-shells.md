Hey Ritluggers,

This week we are discussing all your favorite shells!
Each eboard member is going to give a talk on a different shell.
At the end of the meeting, we will have a fun shell customization workshop. 

If you guys are not already on our slack, join rit-lug.slack.com using your RIT email address.

Hope to see you all there!
