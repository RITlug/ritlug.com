Hey RITlug!

This week's meeting is all about how to make a website with Jekyll. 
Has "make a personal website/portfolio" been on your to-do list for a while?
Come on down to this week's talk to learn how Jekyll may be the answer you're looking for!

Jekyll is great at turning markdown and other plain text into appealing websites and blogs.
Our Project Coordinator, Christian Martin, will be taking over this week's talk to give a presentation and workshop on how to quickly bring up a Jekyll site. 
As this workshop will be interactive, feel free to bring your own laptop and follow along!

Additionally, this is the final call for RITlug jackets! We currently have 10
interested members, and we need 12 to fill our order. 
Jackets are priced at $60.
If you would like a jacket, please fill out the poll in #announcements, or talk to one of our eboard members.
Our deadline for accepting interest in jackets is next Wednesday, April 10th so we have enough time to fill our order before the end of the semester.



See you this Friday!
- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)
