Hey RITluggers,

Welcome to week 10, we're in the final stretch! This week we'll be having a chill session themed around programming in Go. Stop on by to brush up on (or learn) Go, work on some Hacktoberfest projects and have a good time.

For those of you interested, take a look at [The election night hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rits-1st-virtual-10th-annual-election-day-hackathon-tickets-125609426175), signups are open now.

Additionally, as the semester comes to a close, we're beginning to look for new potential eboard members. If you're interested message a member of the current eboard so we know to consider you.

Stay safe, and see you all Friday,
Jake Zaia<br/>
RITlug Secretary<br/>
Certified Rockstar Developer<br />
