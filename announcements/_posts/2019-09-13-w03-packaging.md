Hey Ritluggers,

This week we have a fun talk by Jason Carr about how software is bundled for different Linux distributions.
Jason will compare the major different package managers and dive into topics like cross-distro package managers.
If you know nothing about package managers or, you want to learn how to package software for your favorite Linux distribution, this is a perfect talk for you.

If you guys are not already on our slack, join rit-lug.slack.com using your RIT email address.

Hope to see you all there!
