Hey RITluggers! We've made it to the end!

This will be RITlug's last meeting until spring semester. Since everyone is celebrating the end of classes and starting to prepare for finals, we won't have a formal presentation. Instead, we'll leave the floor open for general discussion, any impromptu talks anyone is interesting in giving (or hearing!), and some reflection on how RITlug was over the semester.

We hope to see you this week but if we don't, good luck on finals and we'll keep you posted on any RITlug news by email, IRC, and on our Facebook page.
