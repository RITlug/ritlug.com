Hey RITluggers,

This week we have Anthony Critelli visiting our club to give a special presentation on kernel tracing.
Anthony Critelli is a Linux systems engineer with interests in automation, containerization, tracing, and performance. He started his professional career as a network engineer and eventually made the switch to the Linux systems side of IT. He holds a B.S. and an M.S. from RIT. If you have no clue what kernel tracing is (like me), or you want to learn all the Linux kungfu, this is a can't-miss meeting.

On November 21st, we are doing a get-together at Bar Louie with the larger FOSS community at RIT.
We plan to arrive at the restaurant around 5:30 PM, we will be carpooling over from the Magic Center around 5:15.
Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/Tyrdu1U53Wyay1QeA) so we can book a spot at the restaurant and know how many people need a ride.

T-shirt sales are live!
If you are interested in a t-shirt, please follow [this link](https://campusgroups.rit.edu/store?store_id=954) to purchase a t-shirt online.
Even if you completed the google t-shirt interest survey, you have to purchase the shirt through this page.
We will close the store on Sunday (11-17-19) so we can place the order and have the T-shirts after thanksgiving break.

If you are interested in helping RITlug present at the Rochester Makerfaire on November 23rd, please contact me ASAP-- preferable at this week's meeting or on slack.
We are looking for 2-3 people to help us present club projects to the general public at this faire.
This year we will be exhibiting Tiger OS, Tux Racer on a Pi 4, Magic Mirrors, and [musical floppy drives](https://jrtechs.net/projects/musical-floppy-drive-build-log).
We can provide transportation -- and food!

Looking forward to seeing you all at this weeks meeting,

- Jeffery Russell (@JrTechs)
