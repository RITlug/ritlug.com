Hey, all you cool cats and kittens,

This is the final email from RITlug this semester. I, for one, will miss composing these slightly memey emails and sending them off to all you lovely people. With that said, we got a few final announcements for the semester.

Virtual FOSS hours will continue through the summer on a bi-weekly basis on Thursdays at 5 pm. More information is on the [FOSS-RIT website](https://fossrit.github.io/announcements/2020/04/28/summer-foss-hours/).

Eboard elections have concluded. Here are the results:

- Henry K: President
- Tim Z: Vice President
- Jake Z: Secretary
- Michael V: Treasurer
- Jeffery R: Officer or something

I'm inviting everyone to join in on the discourse on our slack and telegram channels. RITlug is always looking for new projects and people looking to work on projects. Drop in the #projects channel on our slack, and we can get you rolling on a project. 

As always, stay safe and healthy,

PS: If you have time to kill, consider checking out the new releases of Fedora and Ubuntu.
