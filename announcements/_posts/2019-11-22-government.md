Hey RITluggers,


This week we have Solomon Rubin, an RIT alum, and former RITlug President! In this talk, former-Mitre Solomon Rubin offers a brief look into how the federal government tackles these challenges on a daily basis including how it's evolving: how it contributes to and develops open-source, how it utilizes Innersource within and across individual agencies, and of course, how Gitlab sits at the middle of all of this.


In other news, on November 21st (tonight!), we are doing a get-together at Bar Louie with the larger FOSS community at RIT.
We plan to arrive at the restaurant around 5:30 PM, we will be carpooling over from the Magic Center around 5:15.
Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/Tyrdu1U53Wyay1QeA) so we can book a spot at the restaurant and know how many people need a ride.

T-shirts have been ordered! Thanks to everyone who put in an order for a RITlug t-shirt. They are planning to arrive early December.
We will go more in detail on how we are going to distribute the T-shirts once their arrival date gets closer. Stay tuned!

If you are interested in helping RITlug present at the Rochester Makerfaire on November 23rd (this Saturday!), please contact me or Jeffery ASAP.
This year we will be exhibiting Tiger OS, Tux Racer on a Pi 4, Magic Mirrors, and [musical floppy drives](https://jrtechs.net/projects/musical-floppy-drive-build-log).
We can provide transportation -- and food!


See you all at this week's meeting!
