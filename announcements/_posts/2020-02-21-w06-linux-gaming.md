Hey RITluggers!

This week Dev is giving a talk on the exciting developments in Linux gaming. 

After years of anticipation, 
Linux finally has some traction in the game dev industry. 
Since 2013, things have only gotten exponentially better for gaming on Linux.
So what does Linux gaming look like now, 
and what developments are on the horizon?
Come to this week's meeting to become an Ebic LINUX Gaimer!

### What is RITlug?

RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.
