Hey RITluggers,

This week Joshua Niemann will be giving a comprehensive introduction to securing Linux systems, covering permissions, services, access control, SELinux, AppArmor, and much more. Swing by for a great talk on how to keep your Linux systems succint and secure.

Looking forward to seeing you all there,

RITLUG Eboard
