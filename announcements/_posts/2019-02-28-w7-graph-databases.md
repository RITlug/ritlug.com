Hey RITluggers,

This week we will be talking about graph databases and how they will change the way you think about data.
If you are interested in big data and the oodles of open source software centered around it, be sure to check out this week's meeting.

We now have a #news channel in our Slack where we will be aggregating all the fun Linux news of the week.
We plan on discussing some of these articles during the first few minutes of the meeting before the presentation starts.
If you have some interesting Linux news articles, be sure to drop them off in the #news channel.

Stay toasty,

--Jeffery Russell (@jrtechs)
