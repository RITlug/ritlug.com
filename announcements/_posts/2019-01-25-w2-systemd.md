Hello all RITluggers!

Today's meeting we will hear all about systemd from Garret Arcoraci. 
You might have seen him in the Golisano hallways, or taken a systems administration, virtualization, or network class with him.

Chances are you rely on systemd if you're running linux, but how well do you know what's going on behind the scenes? 
Garret will be talking about targets, dependencies, timers, and more!

See you at the meeting!
