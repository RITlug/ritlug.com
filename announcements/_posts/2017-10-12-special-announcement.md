Hi All,

I am saddened to announce that I will be resigning as Vice President of RITlug and stepping down to an “Officer” position for the remainder of my term. Although I will miss my role as VP, I feel strongly that with my distance from RIT I cannot offer everything that this community needs as a VP. After much thought, I have decided that RIT has not been a good academic fit for me. I have recently accepted a full time position at MITRE where I will be working on open source projects for the US Gov’t.

Justin and myself, along with other eboard members, feel that the longevity of this club and community is the most important thing to maintain. We want to ensure that RITlug and the open source community at RIT have a thriving community for a long time to come. As many of the eboard are graduating soon (within a year) we believe that this is a perfect opportunity to bring some fresh blood onto eboard to jump start the transition to future eboards. Starting Week 8 we will begin to accept nominations for the Vice President position for the remainder of this semester, and the entirety of next. We will hold a special election week 10 to determine our next VP.

Sincerely,
Solomon Rubin (Serubin)
