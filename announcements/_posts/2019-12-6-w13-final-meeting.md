Hey RITluggers,

This week Friday will be the last RITlug meeting of the semester which marks the transition into finals week -- are you excited!
We will be having a few lightning talks, playing games, and doing general Linux shenanigans so be sure to swing on by to de-stress before finals.

We are currently in the process of planning for next semester so, if everyone could give us feedback on this [google fourm](https://forms.gle/9QMTMrtBpgJMQ3eM6) that would be absolutely amazing.

The T-shirts have arrived! If you ordered a t-shirt, please pick it up at either this week's meeting or FOSS hours.
If neither of those times works with you, message me on slack or email and you can pick it up from me sometime during finals week. 

Looking forward to seeing you all at this weeks meeting,

- Jeffery Russell (@JrTechs)
