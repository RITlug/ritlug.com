Hey RITlug!


In preparation for the upcoming virtual career fair, this week we're covering LaTeX! LaTeX is a great tool for building tons of professional documents, including resumes. Come on by to our discord where Jeffrery Russel will be giving a talk on the basics of LaTeX and how you can use it to supercharge your resume.


See you there,

RITLUG Eboard
