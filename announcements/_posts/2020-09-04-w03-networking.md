Hey RITlug!

For this week's meeting, we will have a recent RIT graduate, Nathaniel Larrimore, who will be giving a presentation on Linux networking!
Nathaniel graduated from RIT this past spring from the Networking and Systems Administration program, and is also a prior RITlug eboard member!
He currently works at Arista Networks as a Technical Solutions Engineer.

For this talk, Nathaniel will be giving an overview of his personal infrastructure, general networking basics, as well as giving plenty of Linux networking tips. 



See you there!
- Tim Zabel, RITlug VP
