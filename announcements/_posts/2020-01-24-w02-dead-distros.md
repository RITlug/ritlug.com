Hey RITluggers,

This week Henry is giving a talk on dead and esoteric Linux distributions.
Get ready to learn about everything that you are missing out on in your "normal" Linux distro.

This semester we are looking for two students to join eboard as deputies.
This is a low responsibility eboard role aimed at training people and transitioning them into full eboard positions next semester.
If you are interested, please talk to me (Jeffery) during a meeting or on slack within the next two weeks.
We will announce eboard deputies on January 31st. 

Hope to see you all this week!

### What is RITlug?

RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.
