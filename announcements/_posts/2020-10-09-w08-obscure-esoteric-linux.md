Hello Penguins,

I hope everybody is doing well, and you are all enjoying [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Keeping with the Open Source theme of the month and season, this week's talk will be about obscure and esoteric Linux distributions. Get ready to learn about some really cool, and maybe weird, distros!

If you are interested in working on the club's new project, RITlug's open source Discord bot written in [Go](https://golang.org/), make sure you [register when](http://whenisgood.net/nyrg2gw) you are able to attend our weekly dev meetings.

See you there,

RITlug Eboard
