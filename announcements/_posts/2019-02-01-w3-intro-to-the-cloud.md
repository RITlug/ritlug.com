Hey RITluggers,

I hope that you are all getting through this polar vortex.
This week we will be discussing cloud fundamentals with a focus on containers and security.

If you are interested in how we take x and turn it into a service, swing by this week's meeting. 

Stay toasty,

--Jeffery Russell (@jrtechs)
