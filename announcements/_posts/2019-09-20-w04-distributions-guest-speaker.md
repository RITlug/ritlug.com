Hey RITlug!

This week's talk is brought to you by our guest speaker, Neal Gompa. A DevOps Engineer by day, and an open sourcerer by night, Neal is a prominent member of many different communities. These include Fedora, openSUSE, Mageia, and more!

The focus of this presentation will be on Linux distributions: what they are, how they're built, and *why there are so many*. If you've ever wondered what truly makes a Linux distribution standalone from others, this is the talk for you!


Hope to see you all there! 
- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)
