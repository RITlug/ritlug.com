Hey Ritluggers,

This week we got a very excitting meeting: we are diving deep into SSH.
We are going to cover everything from basic SSH commands to some of the more advance topics.
You need no background knowledge of SSH for this meeting, just show up and learn with us.

After a quick presentation there will be a SSH CTF (capture the flag) esk challenge.

Hope to see you all there!
