Hey RITlug,


Welcome to Hacktober! This month is all about open source and projects. To get in the spirit of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), this week's meeting is going to be an introduction to git. Here, we will cover the basics needed to get up and running, as well as providing an interactive demo at the end!

Additionally, RITlug will be creating an open source Discord bot in the spirit of October. The bot will be written in [Go](https://golang.org/), and we will be hosting weekly meetings throughout the month. Please choose an [initial meeting time](http://whenisgood.net/nyrg2gw) so we can get started as quickly as possible! 



See you there,

RITlug Eboard
