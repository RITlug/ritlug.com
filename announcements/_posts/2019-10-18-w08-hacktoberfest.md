Hey Ritluggers,

I hope you enjoyed your October break, and you're ready to tackle the rest of the semester.

**Hacktoberfest is upon us!**
Participate in some open source projects this month, and **get a free shirt!**
This week we will have a casual project workshop where we will help each other get involved in open source projects.
If you have no clue where to get started or are looking for a project to work on, this meeting is a great way to find those projects. 

Hope to see you all there!
