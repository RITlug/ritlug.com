Hey RITlug!


This week's meeting is a pregame for BrickHack this weekend! We will be doing a quick rundown of our projects, and will be doing preparation for the weekend.
If you would like to work on some projects, or want to introduce some of your own, this is the time to do it. 

We are also now slowly starting the process of preparing for Imagine RIT! If you think of any projects you would like to demo alongside RITlug over the next month, let us know! 



Hope to see you all this week!
- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)

### What is RITlug?

RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.
