Whether you are new to RITlug, or a returning member, I hope you're as excited as we are for this semester!

This year we will be starting off with an informal meeting during the first week of classes (this Friday!).
Each member of the RITlug eboard will be introducing themselves, and giving a lightning talk on their own journey with Linux.

Hope to see you there!

### What is RITlug?

RITlug is a student-led organization to promote and teach students about Linux & open source.
We work on projects and discuss interesting topics in the Linux & open source communities.
**The best way to communicate is in the Slack #general channel**, although for general open source discussion there's more activity in the #foss channel.
