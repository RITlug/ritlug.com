Hey RITlug!

Just in time for Hacktoberfest, this week's meeting is all about Git. We are going to be starting with an introduction to version control systems, and how to use them for your benefit. 

This presentation will also consist of a small workshop, where the prize is gaining access to the GitHub RITlug organization!

Hope to see you all there!
