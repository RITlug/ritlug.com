RITlug presents club projects at the Rochester Maker Faire.

{% include content-blocks/gallery.html %}

> This year at the Maker Faire we presented Jeffery's [musical floppy drive project](https://jrtechs.net/hardware/2018-rochester-maker-faire), a [Lakka](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/easy-retro-gaming-lakka/) gaming set up, our [Magic Mirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [Tiger OS](https://ritlug.com/tigeros).
> The the musical floppy drives are 10 floppy drives wired to an Arduino board which plays MIDI music. The Lakka project is very similar to [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) in that it is a game emulator distribution tailored for the Raspberry Pi.
> The Magic Mirror is an open source smart mirror which runs on the Raspberry Pi.
> Finally, TigerOS is our custom linux distribution based on Fedora which tailors to the needs of RIT students. 
>
> In close proximity to us was the [FOSS@MAGIC](https://fossrit.github.io/) table. This year FOSS@MAGIC presented their MAGIC letters, a Magic Mirror and their website.
>
> This event was a large success for both RITlug and FOSS@MAGIC. 
> Tons of people stopped at our booths-- many of us lost our voices.
> We are all eagerly looking forward to the next Maker Faire.
