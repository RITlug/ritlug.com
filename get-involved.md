Meetings are open to anyone interested, new members and old. RITlug meets {{ site.ritlug-day }}s, {{ site.ritlug-time }} in {{ site.ritlug-place }}. If you can't make the whole time, that's fine! Meetings typically have a presentation first, then we open the floor to discussion and technical help. Interested? Just show up!
