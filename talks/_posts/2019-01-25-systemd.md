`systemd` is a basic building block of modern Linux distributions.
It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.
In this presentation, Prof. Garret Arcoraci introduces `systemd`, where it fits into the distribution, and how it works.
He explains common concepts such as unit files, targets, dependencies, run levels, and more.
