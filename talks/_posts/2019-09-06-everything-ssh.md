In this talk, we did a deep dive into SSH.
This talk covers everything from basic SSH connections and keys to port forwarding over SSH.

After the presentation, there was a CTF-esk (capture the flag) challenge.
Although the CTF is no longer live, you can find the write-up and code for it on  [github](https://github.com/jrtechs/ssh-challenge).
