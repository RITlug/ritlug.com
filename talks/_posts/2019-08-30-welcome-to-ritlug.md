Welcome to another year of the RIT Linux Users Group, fall 2016 edition!

This year started off with an informal meeting during the first week of classes.
This presentation provides a quick overview of the club, who's running the show, some of the things RITlug has done in the past, and involvement opportunities.
At the end of the presentation each eboard member introduced themselves, and gave a lightning talk on their journey with Linux.
