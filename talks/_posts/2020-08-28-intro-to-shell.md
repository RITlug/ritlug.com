In this talk, we did a deep shallow dive into the lovely Linux terminal.
We went over some terminal 101 commands and then dove a little deeper into commands like Git.
Additionally, this talk briefly discussed configuring your terminal with ZSH.

After the presentation, there was a CTF-esk (capture the flag) challenge.
Although the CTF is no longer live, you can find the write-up and code for it on [github](https://github.com/jrtechs/ssh-challenge).
