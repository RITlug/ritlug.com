This talk was given by Neal Gompa, a DevOps Engineer at Datto. Neal is a prominent member of many different communities. These include Fedora, openSUSE, Mageia, and more!

The focus of this presentation is on Linux distributions: what they are, how they're built, and *why there are so many of them*.
