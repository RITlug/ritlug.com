*RITlug hosts weekly meetings every week of classes at RIT. Meetings for Spring 2016 are Fridays from 4â€“6 in Golisano Hall (70/GOL) in room 2520.*

Except in rare occasions, the RITlug schedule is not planned in a definite fashion until the week of meetings. Have something you'd like to see a presentation on or something you'd like to give a presentation on? Get in touch!
