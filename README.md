RITlug's current website.

## Updating Meeting Times/Places
Edit `_config.yml` and update the settings "ritlug-time", "ritlug-place", and
"ritlug-day". These are used (and should be used) everywhere on the website
the meeting time and place are referenced so that they can be updated in
one place.

## Javascript and CSS Patches
There's a couple of patches to the Javascript and CSS. They are:

### Header Height
The default header in Material Design Lite is too large on desktop so we've
shrank it. If you want to change the header height, do the following:

1. Open `css/styles.css`
2. Search for `.mdl-demo .mdl-layout__header-row {`.
3. Find and change the height. Default is 64px. We're currently using 25px.

### Make header links open pages
The default Javascript in MDL <1.0.6 expects the links at the top of the page
to open different tabs. This website is built with pages, not tabs. There&apos;s
a patch in the event handler that enables opening separate pages. Modern
versions of MDL do not require this as they already have the patch implemented.

## Developing and Testing
Test the site by installing jekyll:

    sudo (apt-get install|pacman -S|...) ruby
    sudo gem install jekyll

Then running

    jekyll serve

in the cloned repository. The site will be available on localhost:4000.
